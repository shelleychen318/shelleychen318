## Hi, I'm Shelley ðŸ¤ 

I'm a first year Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo! Currently, I'm looking to expand my knowledge in several fields of technology and design, with a focus on full stack development.

When I'm not coding, you can find me outdoors going on hikes or exploring new restaurants (as evidenced by my profile picture!).

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me!
